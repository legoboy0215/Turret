# Turret

### This is a port of a [Bukkit Turrets plugin](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/turrets). I just ported it and rewrote some important stuff. 
A complex Turret plugin for PocketMine that is WIP. Feel free to submit pull requests to improve this plugin.

Tools used to make this port possible:

[MCP](http://www.modcoderpack.com/) (To decompile the Minecraft 1.12 server.jar)

[PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm) (My favorite IDE)
